# Terminal-Falling-Velocity-of-Sand-Grain
It is a Time Dependent CFD project of measuring velocity using COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS simulation Software which solves the Ordinary differential equation and gives us the results like Velocity and Contour Profile,
Pressure Profile, 3D profile etc.

The first stop for polluted water entering a water work is normally a large tank, where large particles are left to settle. More generally, gravity settling is an economical method of
separating particles. If the fluid in the tank is moving at a controlled low velocity, the particles can be sorted in separate containers according to the time it takes for them to
reach the bottom.This application simulates a spherical sand grain falling in water. The grain accelerates from standstill and rapidly reaches its terminal velocity.

The comsole file is too big to upload,that's why a comsole file without results is being uploaded. To see the results and for detailed analysis
